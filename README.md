# Tree-vs.-Hashing
This project focuses on the application of Hashmap to process and store data. It also compares computational efficiency of Hashmap and other data structures

There are 3 hashing methods used in this project:
1. Open hashing with BST Map
2. Open hashing with Linked list
3. Double hashing for closed Hashmap

To use the first method, run WordCounter.java followed by the name(s) of a text file(s), separated by a space. 
To use the second method, run LinkedListWordCounter.java followed by the name(s) of a text file(s), separated by a space. 
To use the third method, run ClosedWordCounter.java followed by the name(s) of a text file(s), separated by a space. 

Regardless of the methods, the program will run 5 times and calculate the average time it takes to process the file, total word count, and unique word count. Using these data, we can make some assessments about the efficiency of each data structures. Overal, using Hashmap is more time-wise than BST Map
